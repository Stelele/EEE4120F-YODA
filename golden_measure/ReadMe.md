This is the Serial implementation of the LUT-SR Random Number Generator in C++.

# Usage

There are two ways to run the program.

You can run the [lut.cpp](lut.cpp) directly by first compiling the program by entering the below command

```bash

make

``` 

Afterwards you can run the program by entering the below command

```bash

./wire

```

Of note, a Python script is was also created which is the [runnerScript.py](runnerScript.py) that can be used to 
collect testing information quickly. To run it simply enter the below command
